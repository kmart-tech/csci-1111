# CSCI 1111 - Object Oriented Programming I

Hello! My name is Kevin Martinsen. This is one repository for my Java courses at STECH.
You will find projects that I have worked on and am proud of. Take note of the final project. (_they are the most interesting_). These courses are my stepping stone to the fascinating domain of research and technological advances.

Logical thinking, systemmatic building, and problem solving have been always been my passion whether it was building Legos, fixing a household appliance, research in Baumslag-Solitar groups, working with Qubes OS, or tutoring someone in mathematics. There is a strange beauty that results in logical or systematic processes.

Having majored in pure mathematics and falling in love with deductive logic at SUU I turned my attention to programming: a natural application of logic and problem solving. 

Take a look at my code and let it speak for itself.
